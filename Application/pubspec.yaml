  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/key.png
    - assets/person.png
    - assets/patient.png
    - assets/hospital.png
    - assets/wallet.png
    - assets/Room1.jpg
    - assets/Room2.jpg
    - assets/Room3.jpg
    - assets/home.png
    - assets/whitegooglelogo.png
    - assets/Pratik.jpeg
    - assets/tick.png
    - assets/logo.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: FlamanteRoma
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Flamante-Roma-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Flamante-Roma-MediumItalic.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: Nexa
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa_Bold.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa_Light.otf
