##### Project Medical Admittance Provision System
Android/iOS Application to outsource rooms for admitting patients to the general public.

## Background:
In Pune, according to recent statistics there are 2.5 hospital beds per 1000 people. The standard average is 4 hospital beds per 1000 people. To add to this, 70% of these are under private sector which are unafforable by the majority.
To solve this, we can outsource vacant rooms to people who are willing to provide the same for a small sum in return.

## How this benefits everyone:
- It increases accessibility of public healthcare for everyone
- Increases employment opportunities
- Utilises healthcare infra and staff
- Reduces need of newer infrastructure; we will need lesser hospital rooms.

## Possible problems and their solutions:
- Safety of patients, room providers and hospital resources is our top priority. We will have a ranking system and each party involved needs to submit necessary documents to avoid scams and mishappenings.
- The hospital crew may exploit and damage the rooms. The ranking system will also help identify and track down those who violate our TOS and cause damages.
- Often transparency is a blurry line. We aim to provide a simple, yet effective experience. The parties involved need to specify pricing, and any relevant details/terms they wish for others to comply with. None shall be permitted to modify these. Information submitted prior is considered final for all.
- Patients will be also ranked based on their level of emergency and current state. If the patient is not under criteria specified under our TOS, they will not be eligible to avail our services. They will need to hence communicate with the hospital directly. Information of these hospitals can be easily found from our databases.

## Potential roadblocks:
- There may be rooms that are vacant but not in range of the hospital of choice. This can severly affect treatment of the patient and time taken to commute.
